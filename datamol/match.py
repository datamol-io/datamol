    Re-order the nodes of a molecular graph from the nodes of a template molecule.
    Molecular graphs and atom types need to be identical, but edge types and charges

    Parameters:
        mol: The molecule to re-order
        mol_template: The molecule containing the right node order.
        enforce_bond_type: Whether to enforce bond types. Bond types are always enforced
            for a first try. If no match are found and this parameter is `False`,
            the matching is tried again.

    Returns:
        - `None` if the molecular graphs do not match (both the graph and atom types).
