These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab by changing these variables. Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings: * 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis * 1: primary, most important under normal situations * 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations * 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs. */ :root { /* Elevation * * We style box-shadows using Material Design's idea of elevation.

These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab by changing these variables. Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings: * 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis * 1: primary, most important under normal situations * 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations * 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs. */ :root { /* Elevation * * We style box-shadows using Material Design's idea of elevation.

These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab by changing these variables. Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings: * 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis * 1: primary, most important under normal situations * 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations * 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs. */ :root { /* Elevation * * We style box-shadows using Material Design's idea of elevation.

Fix common errors in the mol. Sanitize the mol. Standardize the mol. Generate a standardized SMILES. Generate SELFIES. Generate InChi and InChi key. The resulting dataset can then saved as a CSV file or an SDF file (both files will have the exact same information stored).

These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab by changing these variables. Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings: * 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis * 1: primary, most important under normal situations * 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations * 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs. */ :root { /* Elevation * * We style box-shadows using Material Design's idea of elevation.
